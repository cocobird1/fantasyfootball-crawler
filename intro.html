<h1><strong>Welcome to FantasyFootball-Crawler's Documentation!</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-fantasyfootball-crawler-s-documentation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Fantasy football is a game played by many Americans,
however most are uneducated when it comes to the various in-depth statistics
that are needed to &quot;level up&quot; your team, and potentially win big. Most websites
gloss over important statistics, or don't include all of the information needed
(think FantasyPros), or perhaps include too much information (think pro-football-reference).
I want to build a one-stop-shop for these important statistics. Essentially, this
open source library will give you the best players at each position and filter based
off of statistics that I deem most important to each position in FF.</p>
<p>The Fantasy-Football Crawler library can now accept specified user inputs for the top players,
and sort through specific players based on specific data. Before, the library would use getQBData(),
getRBData(), and getWRData() to simply return DataFrames ranked and sorted based on factors that
I personally thought were the most relevant. However, now, users can use getQBData(metrics),
getRushData(metrics), and getRecMetrics(metrics) to sort QBs, receivers, and runners based on
specified parameters (ex. Yds, Att), and receiving and rushing are both not limited to one position,
but include all rushers and receivers across the league (ex. Rushing Data can include QBs, RBs, and WRs even),
which finally allows us to incorporate players like Travis Kelce into the receiving data.</p>
<p>Further, an aggregate scoring method was also implemented, where users can specify a position
to get a DataFrame that holds the top positional players in terms of Rushing Touchdowns,
Receiving Touchdowns, and Total Touchdowns, which can be very helpful in terms of fantasy.

<p><strong>How to Install Library</strong></p>
<p>To install the library, navigate to your console/terminal and run the command
pip install fantasyfootball-crawler</p>
<p>Then, add this statement to the top of your script:
import fantasyfootball-crawler</p>
<p>Then, you can use the functions! They are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use Library</strong></p>
<p>To use the library, call the functions in functions after you've installed
the library. Make sure to import them into your code files first.</p>
<p><strong>Get QB Data</strong></p>
<p>Users can call getQBData(metrics) with specified throwing metrics, to return a DataFrame that sorts based on the throwing metrics.</p>
<p><cite>metrics</cite>: An array of strings that specify specific metrics to sort players by. Can be any combination of these strings: Player  Age   QBR   Cmp%   Yds  TD  Int</p>
<p>Examples are in <em>Functions and Docstrings</em></p>
<p><strong>Get Rushing Data</strong></p>
<p>Users can call getRushData(metrics) with specified rushing metrics, to return a DataFrame that sorts based on the rushing metrics.</p>
<p><cite>metrics</cite>: An array of strings that specify specific metrics to sort players by. Can be any combination of these strings: Player   Tm  Age Pos   G  GS  Att   Yds  TD  1D Lng  Y/A   Y/G Fmb</p>
<p>Examples are in <em>Functions and Docstrings</em></p>
<p><strong>Get Receiving Data</strong></p>
<p>Users can call getRecData(metrics) with specified receiving metrics, to return a DataFrame that sorts based on the receiving metrics.</p>
<p><cite>metrics</cite>: An array of strings that specify specific metrics to sort players by. Can be any combination of these strings:  Player Age Pos  Tgt  Rec   Yds  TD</p>
<p>Examples are in <em>Functions and Docstrings</em></p>
<p><strong>Get Scoring Data</strong></p>
<p>Users can call getScoringData(pos) with a specified position, to see the top touchdown scorers at each position: QB, RB, WR, and K (most K don't score TD's though)</p>
<p><cite>pos</cite>: A string that indicates the position specified, can be &quot;QB&quot;, &quot;RB&quot;, &quot;WR&quot;, or &quot;K&quot;</p>
<p>Examples are in <em>Functions and Docstrings</em></p>
<p><strong>Weighted Rankings</strong></p>
<p>Users can call weightedRankings(df, weights) with a specified DF, and sort them with the corresponding weights. For most people, they can call another function, like getQBData() for example, to get a DataFrame, and then input their desired weights.</p>
<p>'df': A DataFrame with the statistics and corresponding players
'weights': An integer array that is the same size as the number of columns in df</p>
<p>Examples are in <em>Functions and Docstrings</em></p>
