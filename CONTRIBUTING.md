# What I want to see
I would want to see the implementation of these features:
- Visualization with Graphs (easy)
- Incorporation of ADP and Draft Price
- Weighted Rankings, where each relevant statistic is given a weight, and the players are ranked through that
- Incorporation of Qualitative Data (ie. team movement, trades, free agency, # of alpha receivers)
