Welcome to fantasyfootball-crawler's documentation!
=========================================

Fantasy football is a game played by many Americans, 
however most are uneducated when it comes to the various in-depth statistics 
that are needed to "level up" your team, and potentially win big. Most websites 
gloss over important statistics, or don't include all of the information needed 
(think FantasyPros), or perhaps include too much information (think pro-football-reference). 
I want to build a one-stop-shop for these important statistics. Essentially, this
open source library will give you the best players at each position and filter based
off of statistics that I deem most important to each position in FF.
